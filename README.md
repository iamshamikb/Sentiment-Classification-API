REST API Web App for Sentiment Classification of Reviews

Comparing Models.png contains the performance achieved by different approaches tried.

In Sentiment_Analysis_ML_Spacy.ipynb, tried to see predictions made by TextBlob and NLTK Vader. Then tried TFIDF and BOW with XGBoost, SVC, Multinomial Naive Bayes. Also tried a Deep Learning Model.

Under BERT Model Folder, in Sentiment Classification with BERT.ipynb, tried to use BERT to create a Classifier.

In Web App folder, deployed the BERT Model using Flask to take input from the browser and show it right there.
